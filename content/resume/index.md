## About
I’m Ayodhya Mahesh Babu, a recent B.Tech (Computer Science) graduate and a hands-on fresher focused on full-stack development and cloud engineering. 

I build production-oriented web apps and deploy them to the cloud using CI/CD and container workflows, and I hold an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and I’m currently strengthening my cloud skills through an AWS Cloud training program at Tech Mahindra Smart Academy. 

As a Cybersecurity Intern at Tech Mark HODU Foundation, I performed vulnerability assessments on 15+ Linux systems using Kali, Nmap and Nessus, helped remediate 20+ critical issues (cutting potential exploit risk by 40%), and contributed to a project that won 3rd place in the Bharat Tech League (Smart Farming - AI). 

My strengths are problem solving, adaptability and logical thinking, I enjoy exploring the latest technologies, building side projects, and competing in hackathons.
