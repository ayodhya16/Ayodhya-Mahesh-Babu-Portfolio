Leveraged AWS CloudFront CDN for efficient content delivery and AWS S3 bucket for hosting static website content, ensuring scalability and reliability. Implemented HTTPS protocol for enhanced security, supported by SSL/TLS certificate managed by AWS Certificate Manager. Managed DNS with AWS Route 53 for seamless domain management and resolution. Engineered a view tracking API using Go language, integrated with AWS DynamoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval. Containerized the View Tracking API using Docker for streamlined deployment and scalability. Orchestrated deployment pipeline on AWS utilizing AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy for automated building, testing, and deployment of the API Docker image. Employed various AWS services including IAM Roles and IAM Users for secure access management and authorization. Source Code\r#\rBuild Website\r#\rBuild a simple static Resume Website. I used this Bootstrap Template.\nWebsite Hosting\r#\rHost the content on S3 Bucket\nCreate a S3 Bucket as same name as you Domain name. Remove check from Block Public Access . Upload all the website files. Enable Static Website hosting. Go to Properties \u0026gt; Static website hosting\nEnable it \u0026amp; fill Index Document Go to the URL it has created, you will get 403 error WHY? What happens?\nWe need to allow to access S3 by defining Bucket Policy {\r\u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [\r{\r\u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AddPerm\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*\u0026#34;\r}\r]\r} Now visit the Static website URL of S3 bucket, website is accessible now Issue : We unchecked the Block Public Access, which makes the S3 bucket\u0026rsquo;s content accessible to everyone even to hackers which is an security issue.\nWhy do we need Cloudfront?\r#\rNow our website is publicly accessible, why do we need the Cloudfront.\nCloudFront is a Content Delivery Network(CDN) service also provided by AWS, it enables users to deliver content globally with low latency, high data transfer speed, and securely delivered. leveraging AWS edge locations around the world to cache and deliver content from the nearest location to the user, reducing latency and improving performance. It also offers features such as SSL/TLS encryption, access controls, and real-time metrics.\nIssue : Our Website is not secure, it is using http protocol First, check the Block Public Access on S3 bucket.\nCreate a SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, create this certificate in North Verginia region.\nCreate a CNAME record for this certificate in Hosted Zone.\nCreate Cloudfront Distribution\nAfter creating the CDN, add the Bucket policy (CDN will provide you after creating it) to S3 bucket, so that you can not view content of S3 bucket without bypassing the CDN.\nCreate CNAME record with SSL certificate while creating the CDN, so it can use HTTPS protocol. Visit the CDN url, our resume website is live now, but it is not using our Domain name.\nRoute 53\r#\rTo manage our DNS records.\nCreate a Hosted Zone.\nAdd the Nameservers of Hosted Zone to the Domain Provider Nameservers. Create a A Record in hosted zone for Alias to redirect the request from domain name to CloudFront Distribution.\nCI pipeline for frontend Code.\r#\rWe have to upload modified files to S3 bucket and remove the previous ones.\nUsing Github Actions. Do not use AWS credentials publicly, use them as secret variables. name: Push to S3\ron: [push]\rjobs:\rdeploy:\rruns-on: ubuntu-latest\rsteps:\r- name: Checkout\ruses: actions/checkout@v4\r- name: Setup AWS CLI\ruses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\rwith:\raws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\raws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\raws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}\r- name: Sync files to S3 bucket\rrun: |\raws s3 sync ./website s3://harisheoran.xyz --delete View Tracking API\r#\rAPI is build using Go, Gin Framework and AWS SDK v2. It uses AWS Dynamo DB to store the views.\nWorking : When we send a GET request on \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; endpoint, it fetch the current views and add one more to it and save it to the database.\nContainerize the API\r#\rUsing Go lang as base image, download the dependencies and build a executable file and run it.\nFROM golang:1.22\rWORKDIR /app\rCOPY go.* ./\rRUN go mod download\rCOPY . .\rRUN mkdir build\rRUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o build/main .\rEXPOSE 4000\rENTRYPOINT [ \u0026#34;./build/main\u0026#34; ] My learning \u0026amp; mistakes during building docker image\nLocalhost is the localhost of docker itself not the host machine. Multistage Docker build issue - Can\u0026rsquo;t access the shell of container. Docker Volume helps a lot In development to sync local directory with container Named Volume (Anonymous Volumes) help in not syncing the container\u0026rsquo;s specific directory Bash Script is a must skill to have - $(pwd)\ndocker container run -v $(pwd):/app -v name:/app/main -d -p 4000:4000 --env-file ./.env view_api_img Checking the logs of the container. Setting the environment for container. CI pipline using AWS CodeBuild\r#\rPurpose: To build the API image and push to Docker Hub Registry.\nCreate an IAM Role.\nCreate a Group for the project and attach the policy for AWS CODEBUILD full access.\nCreae a user and add to the group and attach Policies.\nList IAM Role (To attach it in Code build service role) To pass a role to a service (here we are giving role to our CodeBuild service). Pipeline: Checkout the code from Github Repository and use Dockerfile to build the image and push to Docker Hub using Docker Credentials.\nConnect to the Github account.\nNeed a Service Role -\nWHY? : So that CodeBuild can perform action on your behalf. How it works: First for which service you need this role and give it permission(Attach policies) for what it is going to do like in our case it need to access AWS Systems Manager Parameter store. Buildspec file: Define how your CI is going to do.\nSteps:\nLogin to Docker Hub, build the image and push the image\nCredentials: Store them in AWS Systems Manager Parameter store.\nLogs are very important, so use the Cloudwatch logs.\nStore this file in root directory.\n# buildspec.yml\rversion: 0.2\renv:\rparameter-store:\rDOCKER_USERNAME: docker_username\rDOCKER_PASSWORD: docker_password\rDOCKER_URL: docker_url\rphases:\rbuild:\rcommands:\r- cd tracker_api/\r- echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin $DOCKER_URL\r- docker build -t \u0026#34;$DOCKER_USERNAME/view_api_img:latest\u0026#34; .\r- docker push \u0026#34;$DOCKER_USERNAME/view_api_img:latest\u0026#34;\rpost_build:\rcommands:\r- echo \u0026#34;Successfully pushed to Docker hub Registry\u0026#34;\rartifacts:\rfiles:\r- \u0026#39;**/*\u0026#39;\rname: my-artifact CD pipeline using AWS CodeDeploy\r#\rPurpose: To deploy and run the latest code of application on target compute platform.\nIs it looking for change in the codebase? Is it invoked by AWS Pipeline?\nCreate Target Compute \u0026gt; EC2 instance.\nFirst, go to CodeDeploy \u0026gt; Applications \u0026gt; Create application and create an application, choose the EC2 as compute platform.\nCreate Deployment Group.\nInstall the CodeDeploy agent\nWhy do we need CodeDeploy agent? ; It automates code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and instances running on EC2.\nAttach Tags to the EC2 instance. WHY? : Create all the resources of one project under one tag, helps in filtering the AWS resources. Here, we need tag for the code deploy service to id the target EC2 instance, we can assign single or multiple ec2 instances using tags.\nNow, we need a permissions -\nAs, our target EC2 instance going to talk to Code Depoly and vice versa. So, create two service roles, for Code Deploy and EC2. Add another IAM policy to our group to view Tags Keys and values.\nFinally create the Deployment.\nUpload our .env file on EC2 using SSH . It stores the AWS Credentials as API is using Dynamo DB.\nDepolyment Group\nCreate a Deployment Group. Create a appspec.yml\nHere, we define how we want to deploy and run the application, need two scripts to start and stop the container. # appspec.yml\rversion: 0.0\ros: linux\rhooks:\rApplicationStop:\r- location: scripts/stop_container.sh\rtimeout: 300\rrunas: root\rAfterInstall:\r- location: scripts/start_container.sh\rtimeout: 300\rrunas: root Running the API\r#\rRun Migration First from container shell to create the AWS Dynamo DB Table. docker exec -it \u0026lt;docker container id\u0026gt; bash\rgo run migrations/migrations.go ERRORS\r#\rAWS CodeBuild CodeDeploy agent was not able to receive the lifecycle event.
